Pre-Requirements
    We need to check about metrics-server is deployed and working.
    we can check with using this command - kubectl top pods / kubectl top nodes 
if metrics server is not availabe then we need to install it because HPA will work on metrics-server




Horizontal Pod Autoscaler  - HPA 
	• Increasing and decreasing the number of pods or replica
	• HPA automatically scales the number of pods in deployement , sts …etc based on that resources CPU , memori so on 
	• When we set a target CPU utilization % , the HPA scales our application in or out to try to meet that target 
	• HPA needs  k8s metrics server to verify CPU metrics of a pod 
HPA is available in k8s api resources , we don't need to install it
